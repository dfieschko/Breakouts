# DAC7678-Breakout
KiCAD files for breakout boards for TI's DAC7678 I2C-controlled digital-to-analog converters.

There are currently only files for the TSSOP-16 footprint chips. Files for the 24VQFN chips may be forthcoming.

This design was created only recently and hasn't even been realized physically, let alone tested! Test results will be added somewhere in the repository once they're ready.

I am also in the process of writing an Arduino library for communicating with the DAC7678, which can be found here: https://github.com/dfieschko/DAC7678-Arduino.
