# FDC1004Q-Breakout
KiCAD files for breakout boards for TI's FDC1004Q Capacitance-to-Digital converters. To my knowledge, these work identically to the FDC1004, so if that's what you're prototyping for these boards should still work fine.

This design was created only recently and hasn't even been realized physically, let alone tested! Test results will be added somewhere in the repository once they're ready.

I am also in the process of writing an Arduino library for communicating with this chip, which will be uploaded to GitHub and linked here once it's ready.
