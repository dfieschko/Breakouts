# LDC1314-Breakout
KiCAD files for breakout boards for TI's LDC1314 inductance-to-digital converter chips.

This design was created only recently and hasn't even been realized physically, let alone tested! Test results will be added somewhere in the repository once they're ready.

I also wrote Teensy libraries for this chip, which can be ported to other Arduino boards without much hassle. I intend to port the libraries to all Arduino boards in the near future. I also intend to write more thorough instructions and documentation, as well as a quick-start guide.
The libraries can be found here: https://github.com/dfieschko/LDC1312-Arduino
